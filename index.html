		<p>I was tasked with creating a single page website displaying a collection of categorised material related to internet infrastructure around Wellington. 
			On this page I have curated an array of images I believe to be relevant to internet infrastructure. In addition to indoor and outdoor evidence, I have also chosen to include companies and locations linked to internet activity.

		<h3>Grids</h3>

		<p>Use grids to divide up or layout content. For example, putting an image on the left, and lots to text on the right</p>

		<p>I've added a 'show' class so you can see where the grids are. Use chrome's web inspector tools to take a closer look</p>


		<div class="g-row show"> first wrap all grid cells in a g-row
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>

			<div class="g-30 show">
				30% width .g-30
			</div>

			<div class="g-70 show">
				70% width .g-70
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The other cool things about grids, is that 50% width means 50% of the div's <em>parent</em>. This means you can put cells in cells to get infinitly smaller sizes. The possiblities are endless!</p>
